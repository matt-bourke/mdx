// MDX is a custom markdown extension format where custom data can be added to regular markdown tags
// The format is simple and is as follows:

[Markdown Symbol] [{ custom properties }] [Text]

// where custom properties are in the form
.[name]=value

// Multiple properties can be included inside the squirlies, separated by a space

// The motivation behind MDX is to add properties to a resulting HTML file the is generated from the MDX.
// The main use case is expected to be able to add class tags to the HTML elements, so custom styling can be applied.

# { .data=value } Heading 1

// e.g.
# { .class=section-header } Building a Blog 

The MDX to HTML conversion is:

Headers
#           ->  <h1>
##          ->  <h2>
###         ->  <h3>
####        ->  <h4>
#####       ->  <h5>
######      ->  <h6>

Single formatting
` `         ->  <code></code>
** **       ->  <strong></strong>
* *         ->  <em></em>
>           ->  <blockquote>

Lists
1., 2., ..  ->  <ol><li></li>...</ol>
-, ...      ->  <ul><li></li>...</ul>

Images
![x](y)     ->  <img src=y alt=x/>

Rules
---         ->  <hr>
___         ->  <hr> (thick)

Links
[x](y)      ->  <a href=y>x</a>
<x>         ->  <a href=x>x</a>

MDX Custom
~[x](y)     ->  <button onclick=y>x</button>
[ ]         ->  <div></div>
@ @         ->  <nav></nav>
$ $         ->  <span></span>
^^ ^^       ->  code block style
//          ->  comments


Default transformation will use a <p> tag.
An empty block can still have custom properties, e.g.

{ .class=custom-block }
hello this is a stand-alone paragraph

or

{ .class=custom-block } hello this is a stand-alone paragraph


Continuous blocks will be considered part of the same component and have the same properties
Only an empty line will reset the formatter

'\' are interpreted as the escape character and will tell MDX to render the next character as-is.

TBC
- To differentiate div blocks from links, the opening bracket of a div block should be followed by any whitespace
  (' ', '\n', \t), whereas the opening bracket of a link should be followed by a single or double quote

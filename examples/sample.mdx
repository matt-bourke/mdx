# Welcome
Welcome to the MDX Samples Page. This page will serve as both a starting point for referencing the extra syntax that
comes with MDX, as well as reference point to see how components are behaving as development of the standard continues.

This entire page is written using MDX, and the source code can be found [here](https://github.com/mjbozo/mdx/tree/main/examples).

The following is an assortment of MDX components.

> Note: Some examples have had styling applied to better showcase the output.

{ .class=alert }
> MDX is not without is bugs and quirks. It is in active development and everything is still being ironed out.
If you find any issues, please raise an [issue](https://github.com/mjbozo/mdx/issues).

# Properties
**Properties** are the reason for MDX's existence. They allow you to enhance the markdown by adding detail which will
be converted to HTML attributes along with the content.

MDX properties are contained in squirly braces `{}` and are parsed as key-value pairs, and are directly
inserted in the resulting HTML of the following component.

Multiple properties can be added by simply space separating them.

###### Example
^^
{ .class=content .data-index=0 }
This component will be have it's HTML generated with a class of 'content' and data attribute 'index' = 0.
^^

{ .class=example-output } [
	{ .class=example-tag } Produces

	{ .class=container .data-index=0 }
	This component will be have it's HTML generated with a class of 'container' and data attribute 'index' = 0.

# Headings
**Headings** are parsed by starting a line with `#`. Up to 6 `#`s can be specified to create tags `h1` through `h6`.

###### Example
^^
# Heading
^^

{ .class=example-output } [
	{ .class=example-tag } Produces

	# Heading
]


# Paragraphs
**Paragraphs** are created by starting a new line with normal text. They are the default tag for blocks of text.

###### Example
^^
This is a normal paragraph.
^^

{ .class=example-output } [
	{ .class=example-tag } Produces

	This is a normal paragraph.
]

# Spans
**Spans** are created by surrounding elements in `$` symbols. They can be useful for adding some
{ .class=rainbow } $ style $ to in-line text.

###### Example
^^
$ This is a span $
This is a block of text $ containing a span $ in the middle.
^^

{ .class=example-output } [
	{ .class=example-tag } Produces

	$ This is a span $
	This is a block of text $ containing a span $ in the middle.
]

# Divs
**Divs** can be created by surrounding content in square brackets `[]` and are useful for giving structure to the page.

###### Example
^^
[ Simple div on a single line ]
[
	# Complex div
	Can have multiple children
	[ And even nested divs ]
]
^^

{ .class=example-output } [
	{ .class=example-tag } Produces

	{ .class=example-div }
	[ Simple div on a single line ]

	{ .class=example-div }
	[
		# Complex div
		Can have multiple children

		{ .class=example-div }
		[ And even nested divs ]
	]
]


# Buttons
**Buttons** are denoted by the syntax `~[Content](callbackFunction)`. Button Content can consist of simple text or a
series of child components. The callback function is simply the name of the function to be called on button click.

###### Example
^^
~[Click Me](handleClick)

~[Click Me, { .class=rainbow } $ I dare you $](handleClick)
^^

{ .class=example-output } [
	{ .class=example-tag } Produces

	~[Click Me](handleClick)
	~[Click Me, { .class=rainbow } $ I dare you $](handleClick)
]


# Links
**Links** can be added in two different ways. A link can be added to appear 'as-is' by enclosing it in angle
brackets `<>`. For more control over formatting, the second notation can be used: `[Content](url)`.

###### Example
^^
<pre style="display: inline"><</pre>https://ko-fi.com/mjbozo>
[Buy me a coffee (please)](https://ko-fi.com/mjbozo)
^^

{ .class=example-output } [
	{ .class=example-tag } Produces

	<https://ko-fi.com/mjbozo>
	[Buy me a coffee (please)](https://ko-fi.com/mjbozo)
]


# Images
**Images** can be inserted with the syntax `![Alt Text](imageUrl)`.

###### Example
^^
![MDX Logo](https://github.com/mjbozo/mdx/blob/main/mdx-logo.png?raw=true)
^^

{ .class=example-output } [
	{ .class=example-tag } Produces

	{ .style=width:200px }![MDX Logo](https://github.com/mjbozo/mdx/blob/main/mdx-logo.png?raw=true)
]


# Code Blocks
**Code Blocks** are areas you can write multiline pieces of code which will retain formatting. The content is written
between pairs of double carets `^^`. All the examples on this page are done using Code Block components.

###### Example
^^
<pre style="display: inline">^</pre>^
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, MDX!")
}
<pre style="display: inline">^</pre>^
^^

{ .class=example-output } [
	{ .class=example-tag } Produces

^^
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, MDX!")
}
^^
]


# Code
**Code** components are inline versions of code, which are enclosed by a pair of backticks `` ` ``.

###### Example
^^
`console.log("Hello, MDX")`
^^

{ .class=example-output } [
	{ .class=example-tag } Produces

	`console.log("Hello, MDX")`
]


# Lists
**Lists** can be rendered as both ordered and unordered lists by prefixing the list elements numerically or wish dashes.

###### Example
^^
1. First ordered element
2. Second ordered element
...

- First unordered element
- Second unordered element
...
^^

{ .class=example-output } [
	{ .class=example-tag } Produces

1. First ordered element
2. Second ordered element

- First unordered element
- Second unordered element
]


# Strong (bold)
**Strong** components are inline text components that give text a bold look. They are written in MDX by surrounding the
text in double asterisks `**`.

###### Example
^^
Adding some **emphasis** to my docs.
^^

{ .class=example-output } [
	{ .class=example-tag } Produces

	Adding some **emphasis** to my docs.
]


# Em (italic)
**Em** components are also inline text components, but italicise the text instead. They are written by enclosing text
in single asterisks `*`.

###### Example
^^
These docs are getting *zuzzy* as hell.
^^

{ .class=example-output } [
	{ .class=example-tag } Produces

	These docs are getting *zuzzy* as hell.
]


# Block Quotes
**Block Quotes** can also be added by prefixing text with a greater than angle bracket `>`. They can also be nested.

###### Example
^^
> Single level block quote

> First layer
> > And second layer block quote
> >
> > with a second line
^^

{ .class=example-output } [
	{ .class=example-tag } Produces

> Single level block quote

> First layer
> > And second layer block quote
> >
> > with a second line
]


# Nav
**Nav** elements can be added by enclosing other components in a pair of `@` characters.

###### Example
^^
@
	[ Section 1 ]
	[ Section 2 ]
	[ Section 3 ]
@
^^

{ .class=example-output } [
	{ .class=example-tag } Produces

	@
		[ Section 1 ]
		[ Section 2 ]
		[ Section 3 ]
	@
]


# Horizontal Rules
**Horizontal Rules** are added by inserting 3 dashes `-` or underscores `_` in a row.

###### Example
^^
---

___
^^

{ .class=example-output } [
	{ .class=example-tag } Produces

	---

	{ .style=margin-top:16px } ___
]


# Comments
**Comments** are also supported in MDX, simply by prefixing the line with 2 backslashes `//`. Comments do not get
rendered to the HTML output.

###### Example
^^
// This is a comment
^^

{ .class=example-output } [
	{ .class=example-tag } Produces

	// This is a comment
]
